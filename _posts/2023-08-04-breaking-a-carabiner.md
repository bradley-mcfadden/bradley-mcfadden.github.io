title: How I learned to break a carabiner, by accident

Several weeks ago, I was going rock climbing at the Bethel site in 
Sudbury with my friend. Considering I had just ordered some new
9cm carabiners and my first rope, we were both pretty excited. We
would finally be able to set two top ropes at once, which was a big
deal because we could climb two routes before having to climb the
cliff again to move our anchors.

For the uninitiated, a top-rope anchor is in rock-climbing when 
you lack quickdraws or trad gear so that a belayer can catch a 
fall from the climber to prevent an injury. They are usually attached
to bolts drilled into the rock, and consist of a few carabiners and
slings or rope holding the belay rope. Here's an example we set up
from a climb at Timberwolf.

We climbed to the top of the crag and chose two routes to set up.
From the Climb Sudbury routes (available [here](https://www.climbsudbury.com/bethel)), 
we chose routes 9 and 10. I was setting up my anchor at route 10.
I usually use two 9 cm carabiners to clip slings to the bolts,
and the larger 11 cm carabiners to place the belay rope over.
Due to the way the left bolt was oriented against the surrounding
rock, I had a hard time getting my carabiner into the correct
position, where the screwgate would face away from the rope
and the wire part faced downward. I tried to move the chain link
on top of the bolt to make more room, but I ended up getting
the carabiner wedged firmly in-place. A half hour of trying to
pry it free resulted in just disappointment. An image of roughly how
it was stuck is included below:

We still climbed, and we had a decent time, but I could not get
the carabiner unlocked to grab my partner's sling. We decided that
we would come back two days later to remove the carabiner in order
to leave the crag in its usual state, and to recover the sling.

For tools, I bought a cheap hacksaw from Canadian Tire. I made sure to
grab a carbide-tipped blade to cut through the aluminum carabiner, and
bought a few extras incase the blade broke. I also brought a wrench just in case.

We returned to the crag, and climbed back up to route 10. Sure enough,
the carabiner was still there. I unsheathed my hacksaw from my backpack,
and removed the wingnut to turn the blade around. "This should be straighforward",
I thought. And it would have been, had I not dropped the wing nut off the cliff
and into the lake.

Immediately, an overwhelming feeling of stupidity washed over me. I just made
my hacksaw completely useless. Something else would have to do. First, I loosely
clipped into to one of the bolts with a sling and a few carabiners as a light safety.
It would not catch a hard fall, but would provide some pull to keep me from slipping.
I used my wrench around the carabiner and pried as hard as I could. Back and forth,
and back and forth. I was able to rotate the carabiner 180 degrees at some point.
After a few minutes, the lesson about the hacksaw came back to the forefront of my
mind, and I had enough thought to tie the wrench to myself so I would not drop it.

Eventually, when my forearms were pretty pumped after a half hour of this, the
mighty 9 cm carabiner gave way to metal fatigue and snapped. There was no 
obvious damage to the bolt, and we were able to recover the sling. Interestingly,
the carabiner broke at the gate and immediately opposite to the gate, which was
where I used thw wrench.

At the end of the day, there are a few lessons to be learned from this unfortunate
sitation:

1. If it looks like it won't fit, and feels like it won't fit, do not force it.
2. Anything that you cannot afford to drop should be tied to you.
3. Use the right tool, consider a wiregate or a smaller carabiner for tight anchors.
4. Bring a small toolbox along for a climb, just in case.

Hopefully you never make the same mistake as me, and if you do, I hope you have the tools
to fix it the first time around.
