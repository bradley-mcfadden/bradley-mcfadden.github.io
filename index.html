  <p>
    Hello! I am a professional software developer, currently working in Greater Sudbury, Ontario.
    In my spare time, I am a sport rock climber, I enjoy going to the movies, I develop
    games, and I enjoy working out in my living room.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a lifelong learner and I seek to improve people's productivity and safety through the creation of
    reliable interactive software. I look forward to improving the workflows and processes of users of my
    software.
    I have a strong foundation in <i>Java</i>, <i>C#</i>, and the <i>Android</i> framework, but I am always
    looking into applying new tools.

  <p>Most of my professional experience has been with application development. I have
    a great deal of experience with <i>Python</i>, <i>C++</i>, <i>Java</i>, <i>Android</i>, <i>C#</i>,
    <i>Rust</i>, and user interface libraries
    such as <i>Qt5</i>.

  <p>
    I have done some limited web development (see this site for example), but have used APIs of popular
    services like Spotify or Shopify to create tools in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am very familiar with version control systems such as Git, and I have
    experience using <i>Jenkins</i>, <i>Gradle</i>, <i>Cmake</i>, or <i>Apache Ant</i> to improve my productivity
    and
    organize my work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have experience writing unit tests, and have used test frameworks such as <i>Robolectric</i>, <i>JUnit4</i>,
    and <i>Cargo</i> to detect regressions and evaluate my code.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also have worked with a few different databases including <i>MariaDB</i>, <i>MySQL</i> and tools such as
    <i>Android Room</i> for spinning up databases faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've worked with both <i>Godot</i> and <i>Unity</i> in the past as game engines. I mostly make 2D games, and
    due to my familiarity
    with <i>Python</i> I prefer to develop in <i>Godot</i> because <i>GDScript</i> is immediately familiar.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do have some experience working with graphics frameworks like <i>OpenGL</i>. I once used <i>OpenGL</i> to
    create a model viewer type
    program in university, and I explored other topics including animation using inverse kinematics, or wrote
    shaders in <i>GLSL</i>.
