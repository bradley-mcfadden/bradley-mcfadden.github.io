# Bradley's Website

This is going to be a website for my own personal projects. I plan on 
using the site to help develop my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills, as well as
write about past, current, and future ideas I have for projects. When all is
said and done, I hope that it:

- Looks good.
- Provides a solid overview of my experiences on previous jobs, projects, and during my education.
- Helps sell some of my work.
- Provides a facility for me to create my own blog posts about CS related
content, and other hobbies I'm passionate about, like video games and rock 
climbing.
